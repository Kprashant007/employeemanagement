# employeemanagement
ABSTRACT:
"Employee Management System" designs a work schedule. Scheduling makes notifying actions and notifications easy and online in an organisation where it's deployed. Manually arranging personal or official events is time-consuming and can cause confusion if not done effectively. Employee Management System is a distributed programme that manages employee details. It stores employee personal information.
PHP suite of programmes. It's easy to use, especially for those unfamiliar with employee systems. It's user-friendly and gives the user step-by-step possibilities. It's speedy and can handle various business procedures. This software project was made with HTML, CSS, PHP, and Microsoft Sql Server. User-friendly software. Employee and Admin are project components. This programme is multiuser. User comments will be considered for package development.
Problem Statement:.
Manually processing employee data is difficult. This is seen in leave management, where employees must fill out a form that may take weeks or months to approve. Paperwork can lead to human error, wind up in the wrong hands, and is time-consuming. Current systems lack employee self-service; thus employees can't manage their personal information without HR or management. Multinational firms store all employee information at their headquarters, making it impossible to access it remotely when needed quickly. Designing and installing a web-based HR administration system can solve these challenges.
This system will save employee information in a secure database. The project aims to create a password-protected employee information system to track employee performance and achievement. This report documents software and database development.
It includes the development tools used. This system should have an application and a database. Program should retrieve, insert, update, and delete database data. Module development aims to expand capabilities. It's a good idea to design and build the database first, as its structure will affect the rest of the application. The logical database model (tables, content, and relationships) should meet the task's requirements. The program's interface and usability should be excellent. Both controls and forms should logically and functionally link to the programme and database structure.
Another problem is establishing database connections whenever a query is run. During system development, exception-handling should also be considered.
Scope of the project:
Web Design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas design includes web graphic design, interface design, including standardised code and proprietary software, user experience design, and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the of web design process relating to the front design of a website Web design partially overlaps web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark-up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. Web Development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an scope intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server figuration, and e development. Smaller organisations may only require a single permanent or contracting webmaster, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer and/or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.

METHODOLOGY: 
To implement the above goals, following methodology needs to be followed: 
1 Specifying the application and various components of the Web application. Specifying the Models, Repo, Controllers for the Spring Boot Framework Code. Designing the Front end on Javascript for Basic Shopping List activity. Specifying the Port lnterconnections between the resources.
